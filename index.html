  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello, my name is Steven. I like to eat MacDonald and Burger King.</p>
  <p>For MacDonald, I really like Big Mac, Flient-o-fish, double cheese burger, and triple cheese burger. The chicken nugget is also legit, the sauce (sweet and sour) is really good.<p>
  <p>For Burger King, I like Bacon King. I feel like Burger King has more variety on the fountain drinks. The chicken negget is also good. Another thing I really like about Burger King is that they have onion rings. I really really love onion rings<p>
